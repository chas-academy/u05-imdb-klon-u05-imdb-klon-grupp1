## Project Status

Unfortunately, we encountered several challenges during the development process, which led to us stopping before fully completing the project. Here's an overview of the issues we faced:

### Reasons for Stopping

1. **Difficulties with Deployment on Vercel**: One major roadblock we faced was with the deployment of our application on Vercel. We experienced long loading times, causing us to stop the deployment process due to limitations. Indeed, because our project was loading more than 5sec on average, Vercel was timing out because of our current plan (Hobby plan).

2. **Issues with Route Structure and Authentication**: We struggled with the structure of our routes, particularly concerning authentication. This became a significant issue to the progress of the project.

### Attempts to Resolve

To address the deployment issues on Vercel, we attempted to refactor our project, focusing on building a more streamlined structure and removing unnecessary files. However, despite our efforts, we found ourselves running out of time before we could fully rectify the situation. Additionally, we recognized the need for further understanding of authentication in Laravel, which required more time than we had available.

### Lessons Learned

Although we were unable to achieve our desired outcome, this project has been a valuable learning experience for us. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Thorough Deployment Checks**: It's essential to meticulously check the deployment process step by step, ensuring compatibility with the chosen hosting platform.
- **Code Refactoring and Collaboration**: Regular code reviews and collaboration among team members could have helped us identify and rectify issues such as unnecessary files and folder structures.
- **Managing Project Scope**: Recognizing the limitations of our resources and time constraints is crucial in managing the scope of the project effectively. It's essential to avoid adding new features or functionalities when existing ones are not yet stable.
- **Effective Communication**: Maintaining open communication and providing support to each other played a vital role in navigating through the challenges we encountered. 

While we're not entirely satisfied with the result, this project has provided us with invaluable insights into Laravel development, server management, and deployment processes. We're grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and look forward to applying our newfound knowledge to future endeavors.
