# Meeting 23 Feb
- After a long discussion about what we have accomplished and what lies ahead, we've decided to organize our main tasks for the upcoming week. This will ensure that everyone knows what they will be working on and can proceed at their own pace.

## Thoughts during the meeting

- Dennis read documentation on the proper way to use "include" in blades and the files structure. He suggested reading more before proceeding with CRUD operations.

- Nejat worked on the read() function and will push the changes today. Additionally, she's working on implementing destroy() for the admin and is actively reading documentation.

- Emilia expressed her readiness for more work and sought the team's opinion. We collectively reviewed the board and she suggested focusing on the logIn page and Register page, particularly addressing issues with registration lacking a username and login functionality.

- Clara committed to completing the read() function for a specific movie. The read() issues have been resolved, and it's functioning well for everyone.

- Emma worked on the edit() function and related blades. She's currently wrapping up pending issues before proceeding further.

- Looking ahead to next week, we plan to follow up on integrating the blade with the data based on Figma's prototype. Additionally, we've divided the following tasks among the team:

- @Dennis  will focus on all CRUD Functions for the User and will begin collecting real data as soon as the dashboard is completed.

- @Nejat [FWD23]  will handle all CRUD Functions for the Movie and will also collect real data post-dashboard completion.

- @Emilia  is tasked with all CRUD Functions for the Review and will collect real data once the dashboard is done.

- @Emma  will manage all CRUD Functions for the Watchlist and will collect real data post-dashboard completion.

- @ClaraP â˜€ðŸŒ¿  will work on the Dashboard Admin.
