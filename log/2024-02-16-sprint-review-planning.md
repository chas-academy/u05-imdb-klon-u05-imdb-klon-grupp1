# Sprint Review
## 16/02

## Thoughts
- How to divide the issues on 'login' feature
-- One can so the fornt and one can to the backend.
- How to deal with issues and deplyment
- Start with front-end -> Next sprint
- Crud -> Next sprint
- We feel the first sprint was smooth
- Issues could get more defined and specific and smaller
