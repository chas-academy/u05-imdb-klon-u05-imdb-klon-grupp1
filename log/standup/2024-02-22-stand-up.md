# Daily Stand-up 22/02

## Nejat's work
- We had confirmation from Olli-Heikki that we don't need to create a search bar.
- Nejat did the whole homepage (static): caroussel, a row with 5 movies, an upcoming movies part.
- Design created based on desktop first => adapt it to mobile first (maybe columns instead of rows), and use media query for desktop.

## Thoughts
- Filter by genre: we will use buttons to choose the genre (look at Figma) OR we can also use caroussel by genre.

## Next steps
- Frontend next step: dashboard for Admin, so we can add movies directly from this
- CRUD functions first = create the read function in the corresponding Controller + create a new blade to display it (without creating design for the moment)

- Read() = display all movies (for user, visitor and admin)
- Read() = display all users (for admin)
- Read() = display a specific movie (for user, visitor and admin)
- Read() = display all reviews (for a movie)

## Todos (+ create an issue before working on your new task)
- @Emma: Create a grid to display all the movies
- @Nejat [FWD23]: Read() = display all movies (for user, visitor and admin), just in the Controller, not the blade because Emma is taking care of it
- @Dennis: Read() = display all reviews (for a movie)
- @Emilia : Read() = display all users (for admin)
- @ClaraP â˜€ðŸŒ¿ : Read() = display a specific movie (for user, visitor and admin)
